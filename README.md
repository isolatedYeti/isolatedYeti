-Hey, I'm @isolatedYeti.

-I love coding and I wholeheartedly believe in libre software and straying from proprietery software as it is far too often dangerous and unsecure.

-I'm currently learning Java, Go, Nim, and ASP.NET Core; I know Java, C++, and Javascript pretty well :)

-I would love to collaborate on absolutely anything as long as it's extremely simple, as I'm a self taught programmer missing a lot of information

-you can reach me through my email, isolatedyeti@protonmail.com for any questions, requests, or collabs!

if you're reading this I love you and hope you have a wonderful day <3
